This notebook compares the performance of two models:
1. Random Forest
2. Neural Network (2 Dense layers/3 Dense layers/3 Dense layers + L2 norm)

...on the prediction of aggregated median house prices in Californian neighborhoods. Predictors include coordinates of neighborhoods, proximity to the ocean, and several aggregated house/population properties. The dataset is publicly available here:
